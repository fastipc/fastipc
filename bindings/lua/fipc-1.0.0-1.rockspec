      The LuaJIT binding of FastIPC, a small library written in Zig: a server listens on a name and accepts one
      client at a time, a client connects to the name, and each connection has a shared-memory ring per direction.
      Plain messages of any size, zero-copy messages and RPC, timeouts and the peer's end reported at once. Through
      LuaJIT's FFI: one Lua module and the native library for Windows x64, Linux x64 and arm64 (glibc 2.34+) and
      macOS arm64 (14.4+), no compiler needed. Its peer can be written in any language with a binding: Zig, C, C++,
      Python, C#, Java, Rust, Lua, JavaScript or Go.
